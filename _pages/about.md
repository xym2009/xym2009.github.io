I am currently an Associate Professor with the Key Laboratory of Technology in Geo-spatial Information Processing and Application Systems, _Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences_, Beijing, China. 

I received my B.S. degree in Department of Electronic Engineering, _Tsinghua University_, 2013, and my Ph.D degree in School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, _University of Chinese Academy of Sciences_, 2018. 

I received the _Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award of Chinese Academy of Sciences_ in 2019. 

My current research mainly lies in image registration and 3D reconstruction using multi-sensor remote sensing images.
